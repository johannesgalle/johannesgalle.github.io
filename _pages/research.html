<summary markdown="span"><font color="blue">Place-based policies, structural change and female labor: Evidence from India's Special Economic Zones</font>
(with <a href="https://danieloverbeck.github.io/" target="_blank"> Daniel Overbeck </a> ,  <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/riedeleconomics/welcome" target="_blank">Nadine Riedel</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/tobiasseideluni/home-1" target="_blank">Tobias Seidel</a>) <br />
<b>  <strong> <i>Journal of Public Economics, 2024 </i> <strong>  </summary>
  
This paper quantifies the local economic impact of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) that were established in India between 2005-2013. Based on a novel data set that combines
census data on the universe of Indian firms with georeferenced data on SEZs, we find that
SEZs increased manufacturing and service employment with positive spillover effects up to
10km. This employment gain was paralleled by a decline in local agricultural employment,
in particular of women, suggesting that the policy contributed to structural change. We find
no evidence for heterogeneous effects between privately and publicly run SEZs or zones with
different industry denominations.

<summary markdown="span"><strong>Carbon taxation in emerging economies<strong>

(with Daniel Overbeck, Rodrigo Oliveira, Nadine Riedel and Edson Severnini)<br />
<b> <i> UNU-WIDER grant (USD 10,000) </i> </b> </summary>
  
This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of how firms respond to carbon taxation
in emerging economies. Our evidence builds on exhaustive administrative data from South
Africa, the 13th largest emitter worldwide. The results are twofold. First, we establish
stylized facts on the types of firms that are affected, how much revenue is generated from
which sector, and which share of national emissions the tax is able to capture. Second, we
study the dynamic impacts of the carbon tax on firm-level outcomes such as profits, sales,
capital, and labor inputs. We show that the design of the South African carbon tax leads to
substantial heterogeneity across sectors in terms of how strongly firms are affected. Contrary
to the concern that carbon tax may hinder economic growth we measure no negative effects
on firm performance on average.
