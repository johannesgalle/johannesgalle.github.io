<p style="font-size: 12px;">This paper quantifies the local economic impact of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) that were established in India between 2005-2013. Based on a novel data set that combines
census data on the universe of Indian firms with georeferenced data on SEZs, we find that
SEZs increased manufacturing and service employment with positive spillover effects up to
10km. This employment gain was paralleled by a decline in local agricultural employment,
in particular of women, suggesting that the policy contributed to structural change. We find
no evidence for heterogeneous effects between privately and publicly run SEZs or zones with
different industry denominations.</p>
