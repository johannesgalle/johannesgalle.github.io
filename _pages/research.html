  <summary markdown="span"><font color="blue">Place-based policies, structural change and female labor: Evidence from India's Special Economic Zones</font>
  (with <a href="https://danieloverbeck.github.io/" target="_blank"> Daniel Overbeck </a> ,  <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/riedeleconomics/welcome" target="_blank">Nadine Riedel</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/tobiasseideluni/home-1" target="_blank">Tobias Seidel</a>) <br />
  <b><i>Journal of Public Economics, 2024</i></b> </summary>
  
<p style="font-size: 16px;">This paper quantifies the local economic impact of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) that were established in India between 2005-2013. Based on a novel data set that combines
census data on the universe of Indian firms with georeferenced data on SEZs, we find that
SEZs increased manufacturing and service employment with positive spillover effects up to
10km. This employment gain was paralleled by a decline in local agricultural employment,
in particular of women, suggesting that the policy contributed to structural change. We find
no evidence for heterogeneous effects between privately and publicly run SEZs or zones with
different industry denominations.</p>

    <font color="blue">Indian Agriculture Under Climate Change: The Competing Effect of Temperature and Rainfall Anomalies</font>
    (with <a href="https://www.pik-potsdam.de/members/anjaka/homepage" target="_blank">Anja Katzenberger</a>) <br />
    <b><i>Economics of Disasters and Climate Change, 2024</i></b>
  </summary>

  <p style="font-size: 16px;">
    The latest generation of global climate models robustly projects that monsoon rainfall anomalies in India will significantly increase in the 21st century due to global warming. 
    This raises the question of the impact of these changes on the agricultural yield. Based on annual district data for the years 1966-2014, 
    we estimate the relationship between weather indices (amount of seasonal rainfall, number of wet days, average temperature) and the most widely grown kharif crops, including rice, 
    in a flexible non-parametric way. We use the empirical relationship in order to predict district-specific crop yield based on the climate projections of eight evaluated state-of-the-art climate models 
    under two global warming scenarios for the years 2021-2100. We find that the loss in rice yield by the end of the 21st century lies on average between 3 - 22% depending on the underlying emission scenario. 
    For the sustainable scenario impacts range from an increase of 3.2% to a decrease of 12.1% for individual districts. In the worst-case scenario, all districts are negatively affected, 
    with a predicted decrease in rice yield ranging from 34% to a decrease of 11.5% in the long run. Potential gains due to increasing rainfall are more than offset by the negative impacts of increasing temperature. 
    Adaptation efforts in the worst-case global warming scenario would need to cut the negative impacts of temperature by 50% in order to reach the outcome of the sustainable scenario.

    <font color="blue">City Shape and Air Pollution</font>
  </summary>

  <p style="font-size: 16px;">
  Air pollution has become an increasing health threat for the local population in many cities around the world. 
    Using high resolution remote sensing data on nightlights and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) for the years 1998-2013, I study the contemporary nexus between city shape and air pollution in India.
    I find that the compactness of a city has statistically significant and negative effects on local air quality. 
    The results are more pronounced in larger cities and robust with respect to different compactness measures. While geographic dispersion allows for more fresh air corridors, 
    differences in commuting patterns could serve as an additional explanation. People in less compact cities are more likely to use public transport and thereby reducing the overall road traffic 
    within cities translating into less pollution. However, the statistically significant effects do not translate into substantial changes in the relative risk of PM2.5-induced diseases.

    This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of how firms respond to carbon taxation
    in emerging economies. Our evidence builds on exhaustive administrative data from South
    Africa, the 13th largest emitter worldwide. The results are twofold. First, we establish
    stylized facts on the types of firms that are affected, how much revenue is generated from
    which sector, and which share of national emissions the tax is able to capture. Second, we
    study the dynamic impacts of the carbon tax on firm-level outcomes such as profits, sales,
    capital, and labor inputs. We show that the design of the South African carbon tax leads to
    substantial heterogeneity across sectors in terms of how strongly firms are affected. Contrary
    to the concern that carbon tax may hinder economic growth, we measure no negative effects
    on firm performance on average.

   This paper quantifies distributional effects of the recently proposed EU-CBAM on Households in trading partner countries.
   We develop a Ricardian type trade model to derive sectoral income and price
effects of the CBAM both in the short and in the long run. We combine the model output
with detailed household-level consumption data for each of the countries and thereby explore
horizontal and vertical distributional impacts of the EU-CBAM at the household-level for
a selected subset of the msot affected coutnries.

  <p style="font-size: 16px;">
   This paper presents a Melitz-style model of asymmetric countries to identify the
optimal environmental policy response to a Border Carbon Adjustment (BCA) from
an emerging economy perspective. We calibrate the model with detailed Indian firm
data on emissions, productivity and exports. In a quantitative simulation, we show
that the presence of a BCA strongly reduces the welfare costs of raising India’s
emission tax to the level of that of the EU. Further analysis shows that there are
substantial differences in the distribution of welfare costs across sectors. Finally, we
show that this welfare smoothing effect is decreasing in productivity and thereby
limiting the incentive to raise domestic carbon price in the least developed countries.

  <p style="font-size: 16px;">
This chapter conceptualizes the distributional impacts of energy innovation adoption. Fol-
lowing the existing literature on energy innovation, we provide a conceptual framework
to map costs and benefits from energy innovation adoption at various levels, including
households, firms, and governments. We first conceptualize the relevant decision-making
dimensions at the micro and the macro level for determining distributional effects of energy
innovation adoption. We then illustrate how the conceptualization can be applied to Indian
household consumption data. Our results are twofold. First, the conceptual findings res-
onate well with empirical findings showing that early adopters of energy innovation tend to
be richer households. Second, as long as energy innovation policy induced costs are propor-
tional to income, they do not create additional vertical distributional impacts. Finally, we
discuss how costs and benefits of energy innovation on avoided climate impacts and stranded
assets would be distributed.
