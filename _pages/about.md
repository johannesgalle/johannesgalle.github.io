Welcome! I am currently working as a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Climate Policy and Development](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/institute/departments/climate-economics-and-policy/research/climate-policy-and-development) research group at the [Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/institute/departments/climate-economics-and-policy).  My research interests are in development, environmental and regional economics. I obtained my PhD from Ruhr University Bochum, where I was part of the Research Training Group on [Regional Disparities and Economic Policy](https://www.regional-disparities.de/) funded by the German Research Foundation. I am also a Research Fellow at [RWI](https://www.rwi-essen.de/en/forschung-beratung/weitere/rwi-research-network/team).
